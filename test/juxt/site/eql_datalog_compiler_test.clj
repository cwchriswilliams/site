    ;; Add a /patient/XXX resource to serve an individual patient.

    ;; https://auth.hospital.com/actions/get-patient must perform an XT query.

    ;; In the future, it would be good if the http request can include a
    ;; header indicating the minimum required version in order to provide
    ;; read-your-own-writes consistency. Perhaps use standard http
    ;; conditional request headers for this.

    ;; The GET pathway skips the tx-fn (in the non-serializable case),
    ;; proceeding directly to calling add-payload.

    ;; Note: it would be useful to research whether a Flip database query
    ;; could be automatically limited by the actions in scope. This would
    ;; make it safer to allow people to add their own Flip quotations.

    ;; Here we have the conundrum: when the
    ;; https://example.org/actions/get-patient action rule has the clause
    ;; '[resource :juxt.site/type
    ;; "https://example.org/types/patient"]' then it is not a permitted
    ;; action. We must separate the actions that allow access to a
    ;; uri-template'd resource and the actions that create the body
    ;; payload.

    ;; Modelling ideas

    ;; Doctor's have patients, patients have an assigned doctor.
    ;; A measurement must be taken by a doctor or other individual.
    ;; From the doctor, you can see patients.
    ;; A patient should be able to see their own medical file.

    ;; See NHS National role-based access control (RBAC) for developers
    ;; "The database consists of:
    ;; Job Roles (âRâ codes) - the set of roles that can be assigned to users, for example Clinical Practitioner (R8000)
    ;; Activities (âBâ codes) - the set of activities that users can perform, for

    ;; https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/spine-directory-service-fhir

    ;; Additional scenarios:

    ;; Alice, Bob, Carlos - multiple joins, 3-level queries, multiple concurrent actions

    ;; The challenge is to combine the following:

    ;; 1. GraphQL schemas where fields in queries reference actions. For example:
    ;;
    ;; type Hospital { patients: [String] @site(action: https://auth.hospital.com/actions/list-patients) }
    ;;
    ;; type Doctor { patients: [String] @site(action: https://auth.hospital.com/actions/list-patients-by-doctor) }

    ;; Should https://auth.hospital.com/actions/list-patients-by-doctor exist
    ;; independently or instead be a reference to
    ;; https://auth.hospital.com/actions/list-patients with a join key? The former
    ;; is overly cumbersome and would require a lot of extra actions and
    ;; associated admin costs. (DONE: we have gone with the notion of an action being called in the context of another)

    ;; type Doctor {
    ;;   id ID
    ;;   patients(gender: String, costBasis: String): [Patient] @site(action: "https://auth.hospital.com/actions/list-patients" join: "primary-doctor")
    ;; }

    ;; The `patients` field transforms to a sub-query.

    ;; This sub-query is composed using the rules of list-patients.

    ;; Additional clauses are added that correspond to the arguments, with
    ;; optional arg->attribute mappings specified in (GraphQL) field
    ;; directive.

    ;; The 'join' key becomes an implicit argument. By default, the 'id' of
    ;; the doctor is passed as the argument value.

    ;; But, for many models, there is a xref relation. A patient's
    ;; relationship to a doctor is governed by a dedicated 'assignment'
    ;; document. This way, it is straight-forward to remove this assignment,
    ;; inspect a history of assignments, and to add further metadata about
    ;; the assignment.

    ;; The 'form' of the GraphQL should not expose this xref relation
    ;; directly, but use it to generate a mapping between patients and
    ;; doctors.

    ;; Where should the metadata for this xref relation be provided? For
    ;; example, if the assignment document has a type (and it certainly
    ;; should), where should this type be specificed? If it's directly in
    ;; the GraphQL SDL, then a) it both complicates and exposes the GraphQL
    ;; SDL to structural details and b) needs to be repeated for other
    ;; access protocols, like REST.

    ;; Therefore, it makes sense that the actions themselves understand how
    ;; to navigate these relationships. Actions can be both shared between
    ;; applications while still allowing applications to demand bespoke
    ;; actions where necessary.

    ;; Therefore it seems that actions are the 'form' documents.

    ;; Let's take the list-patients action. In the context of a doctor, it
    ;; needs to know how to join on the doctor id. The 'parent context',
    ;; whether it be a hosital, doctor or other type, is extremely common
    ;; (since data is often emitted as DAGs). Therefore each action should
    ;; be aware of the context in which it runs.

    ;; 2. Actions that have 'query' logic. Should that query logic be Flip?
    ;; Or reference other actions? To what extent is 'list-patients = fmap
    ;; get-patient' - is this a common case? Looks like we may need a
    ;; 'calculus' for defining actions in terms of other more fundamental
    ;; actions. Note: I think we're just seeing that get-patient and
    ;; list-patient *share* the same rules. There is no reason rules can't
    ;; be deduped via reference to independent documents, or even one to the
    ;; other:
