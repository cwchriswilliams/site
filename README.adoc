= Site (2.0)

Site is a standards-compliant web server, fulfilling the roles of an https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749[OAuth2] resource server and authorization server.

[quote,https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.1]
--
resource server:: The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.
--

Resources are documents which represent a resource's identity (URI), configuration and current state (which might be some data, image or other media).
Site stores resources in a database.

A resource request is a standard web request to a URI (as part of an API, such as https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI]) or https://graphql.org/[GraphQL] request.

Requests contain an access-token, acquired from an authorization server:

[quote,https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.1]
--
authorization server:: The server issuing access tokens to the client
after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining
authorization.
--

Currently, the only supported database is JUXT's immutable https://xtdb.com[XTDB] database.
XTDB is a good fit for Site, since many of its features (such as document ids and references) map cleanly onto web concepts (such as URIs and links).

== When would you use Site?

Site might be a good choice if one or more of the following apply:

* you are developing an application and want to centralise common data such that it can be shared securely with other applications.
* you have strong requirements for security and access-control over your data.
* you want to access your data over web protocols, such as OpenAPI and/or GraphQL.

== Features

Current development is still focussed on the technical feature set, as required to conform to the relevant standards and provide good interoperability.

=== Resource Server

* Content Negotiation
* Conditional Requests
* Access Control (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control[RBAC], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control[ABAC] or policy based)
* GraphQL

=== Authorization Server

* Client Registration
* User Authentication (Basic, Login form, OpenID)
* OAuth2 access token grants

== Programming Site

Some types of resource, such as 'actions', may contain Site 'programs' that are executed when required.
All resources are stored in the database, including all program code.

Currently, the only available programming language is https://github.com/babashka/sci/[SCI].

== Status

The previous 1.0 generation of Site is maintained at https://github.com/juxt/site.

This 2.0 generation is in development. Please do not use until further notice.
