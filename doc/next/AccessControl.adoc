== Introduction

Consider the English sentence:

"The cat sat on the mat".

The 'cat' is the *subject*.
The word 'sat' is the _verb_ (which we will call the *action*), and the 'mat' is the _object_ (which we will call the *resource*).

When considering **access control**, we might rephrase the sentence as a question:

"Is the cat allowed to sit on the mat?".

If we were to ask a different question, such as:

"Is the _dog_ allowed to sit on the mat?", or

"Is the cat allowed to _wee_ on the mat?", or

"Is the cat allowed to sit on the _sofa_?",

then we may get different answers.

The point is, we cannot effectively control access to resources without considering the subject, action and resource _together_.

The chapters that now follow cover subjects (<<ch-subjects>>), actions (<<ch-actions>>) and resources (<<ch-resources>>), including examples.
