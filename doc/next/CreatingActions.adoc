= Creating Actions
:toc: left
:experimental:

We are now ready to create and perform actions.

== Creating the action to permit actions

One action that we need to create immediately is an action to grant a permission.

Now that we have our system subject, and our `create-action` action, we can call `do-action`.

`do-action` is a function that takes the following arguments:

* the subject identifier (in this case, `+https://site.test/subjects/system+`),
* the action identifier (in this case, `+https://site.test/actions/create-action+`),
* a document

The actual call to `do-action` is shown below:

[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=create-grant-permission-action!,indent=0]
----

NOTE: We would usually have to grant permission to our system subject for this action.
However, this permission was already installed in <<bootstrap-install-system-permissions>>.
