= Preliminaries

If you're in a hurry, or want to get started quickly with Site, you should skip
these chapters and move onto <<ch-resources>>.

However, in keeping with our value of <<understanding,Understanding>>, we
recommended that you invest time in building up both your working and conceptual
knowledge of Site. These chapters will help to build up your knowledge of Site
'from scratch'. If you've chosen this course, welcome to the slow track!

= Authentication

(((authentication, definition)))
Authentication is the process by which a user is identified.

(((access control)))
In Site, Actions are integrated with authorization rules, providing a rich access control
layer between users and data.

(((Subject)))
Most authorization rules refer to the Subject of the request. To identify the
Subject, we need to authenticate each request.

Site supports two types of user authentication:

(((authentication,HTTP))) *HTTP Authentication*, which introduces the concept of
_protection spaces_, specified in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7235[RFC
7235], is described in <<ch-http-authentication>>. An example of HTTP
Authentication is the 'Basic' authentication scheme, which is covered in
<<ch-basic-authentication>>.

(((authentication,session-based))) *Session-based Authentication*, which we
describe in <<ch-session-authentication>>, opens up numerous additional options
for authentication. One such option is authenticating via an HTML form, which is
covered in <<ch-form-based-authentication>>. Another is with the OpenID Connect
protocol, which is covered in <<ch-openid>> with a worked example.

= Applications and APIs


First, in <<ch-applications>>, we introduce Applications and create the required
Actions.

We start by configuring our Authorization Server in <<ch-authorization-server>>.

Then, in <<ch-first-application>>, we create an example Application.
