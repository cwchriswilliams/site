== Introduction

Actions are performed in transaction functions. A transaction function must
return one or more transaction operations that will be submitted to the database
atomically.

Often, actions are required to validate input and construct documents that must
be put into the database.

Pipe is a language that is used in transaction functions which is designed for
the purpose of producing transaction operations.

Pipe is a stack-based

drawing heavily from https://factorcode.org/[Factor] and
