= Form-Based Authentication

== Introduction

In this chapter we'll create a login form that will allow a user access to a
protected resource.

We'll need to create the following resources:

. A document at `+https://site.test/protected-by-cookie-scope/document.html+`
which requires the User can perform the Action
`+https://site.test/actions/get-protected-resource+`. We'll called this the
_protected document_. This is explained in <<create-resource-protected-by-cookie-scope>>.

. A Permission to allow Alice to access this protected document. This is added
in <<grant-permission-to-resource-protected-by-cookie-scope>>.

. A Cookie Scope that redirects unauthenticated requests when necessary. This is done in
<<create-cookie-scope>>.

. A login form that will be shown to the User, allowing them to authenticate.

. A resource that can receive the POST request that occurs when a User submits the login form.

. An Action that can be used when the POST request is received. This Action will
attempt to find a User Identity that matches some received credentials. If one
if found, the Action will create a Subject in the database.

. A User Identity for Alice, including a username/password pair, that Alice can use
to authenticate using the form. This is added in <<cookie-scope-add-user-identity>>.

<<cookie-scope-flow>> shows the interaction between the components.

....

In <<cookie-scope-flow>>, the following steps are illustrated:

. The browser sends a GET request to the protected document:
`+https://site.test/protected-by-cookie/document.html+`

. The operation is associated with the Action
`+https://site.test/actions/get-protected-resource+` and a check is made for a
permission to perform this Action.

. No permission is matched, the request is denied.

. In denying the request, a Cookie Scope is looked up.

. One is found and returned, associated with the URI of a login form.

. A `302 Found` response is send containing a `Location` header of the URI of
the login form.

. The browser redirects to URI contained in the `Location` header of the
previous response.

. The URI locates a resource which returns the HTML of a login form, with an
`action` attribute containing the URI of a resource that will handle the
credentials.

. Alice enters her credentials and clicks btn:[Submit].

. The browser makes a POST request to the resource identified by the form's
`action` attribute, with a body that contains the credentials.

. The operation is associated with the Action
`+https://site.test/actions/login+` and a check is made for a permission to
perform this Action. Since the login form is intended as a public resource, a
permission is found and the request proceeds.
